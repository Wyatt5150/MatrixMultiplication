# MatrixMultiplication
The objective of this project is to design several matrix multiplication algorithms which implement varing levels of threading.

The program recieves input through Matrices.txt which contains a list of matrices that will be multiplied in pairs. A matrix's rows are on sequential lines with each element in the row being separated by a space, so the matrix appears how it would on paper within the file. Different matrices are separated by an empty line.
The matrices are assumed to be square. If there is an odd number of matrices, the last matrix will be ignored.

For each multiplication, the program will display the two matrices to be multiplied together, the product, and the time to execute the multiplication.
